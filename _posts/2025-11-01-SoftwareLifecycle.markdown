Two types of software development models: Plan Driven and Agile. <br>
There are several phases of software development. This is not something that you must follow in order and these can overlap too. There is Requirements, Design, Implementation, Test, and Deployment. Now for Requrements and Design, it would be useful to start these before your Implementation. Implementation and Testing can go hand in hand. Deployment can vary depending on a Plan driven or Agile model. For a Plan driven model, you can deploy in one go. For an Agile model, you can deploy parts of your software for feedback from users and start the phases of software development again for a different part of the software. This may prevent premature optimization. <br>

Plan driven models are usually used for projects where you know the requirements up front. These typically follow the phases of software development in the order and deploy software in one phase. <br>
On the other hand, Agile models are usually for projects where there can be a lot of change in what the user wants. The phases of software development are followed, but only parts of the software is deployed and then evaluated by users for feedback. This tpye of deployment can also be called continuous integration. <br>
Another name for a Plan driven model is a Waterfall model. Another name for an Agile model is an Iterative model.
<br>
Software Artifacts are anything related to the development and maintanance of a software. <br>
Task Planning is important for considering **deliverables** and planning how to complete them.
